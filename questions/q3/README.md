An Investor has saved some money and wants to invest in the stock market. There are a number of stocks to choose from, and they want to buy at most 1 share in any company. The total invested cannot exceed the funds available. A friend who is a stock market expert has predicted the values of each stock after 1 year. Determine the maximum profit that can be earned at the end of the year assuming the predictions come true.

### Example

```
saving = 250
currentValue = [175, 135, 109, 210, 971]
futureValue = [200, 125, 128, 228, 133]
```

To maximize profits, the investor should buy stocks at indices 2 and 4 for an investment of 109 + 97 = 206. At the end of the year the stocks are sold for 128 + 133 = 261, so total profit is 261-206=55.

selectStock has the following parameter(s):

- int saving: amount available for investment
